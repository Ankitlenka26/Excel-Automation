# to run the files

python "filename"

# Input process : readExcel.py

we take the input excel with the name "input.xlsx" and export gameIds, noOfGamesPerBoot, bootDurations and bootPrices into our main file

# Main.py

In main.py we will process the input information and then using that we will then generate the output object which we need to display in our excel

# Output Process : writeExcel.py

Here we import the object generated in the main file and then display it to excel using openpyxl
